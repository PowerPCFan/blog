I wanted to make a table for myself to compare Windows 11 editions and I figured I'd upload it here!

Key terms to know:  
- **LTSC: Long-Term Servicing Channel**
  - These versions of Windows get extended support for 5 to 10 years, and they only get bug fixes and security updates until the next LTSC version is out.
  - Outside of Windows editions, versions that get extended support are commonly known as LTS (long-term support) versions. LTSC is the same thing.
- **IoT - Internet of Things**
  - IoT devices include embedded devices, such as kiosks, ATMs, point-of-sale (POS) terminals, and industrial computers.
  - IoT versions of Windows are intended for IoT devices.
- **VDI - Virtual Desktop Infrastructure**
  - A setup sometimes used in enterprise and education environments where multiple virtual desktop environments are hosted on a central server, and each user connects to their own virtual desktop.
