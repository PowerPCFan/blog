In 2025, there are so many different browser options that it can be very confusing trying to choose one. All of them have different pros and cons, strengths and weaknesses. So let's go over the most popular browsers on the market and compare features!

# The Lineup
In this article we'll be covering these browsers:
- Google Chrome
- Microsoft Edge
- Mozilla Firefox
- Brave
- Opera
- Vivaldi
- Safari

# The Showdown

## Platforms
Shown below are the platforms that the browsers support.

| Browser            | Platforms                           |
| ------------------ | ----------------------------------- |
| **Google Chrome**  | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android |
| **Microsoft Edge** | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android |
| **Firefox**        | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android |
| **Brave**          | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android |
| **Opera**          | Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android |
| **Vivaldi**        | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android      |
| **Safari**         | macOS, iOS                          |

As you can see, the majority support all the major platforms: Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, and Android.

## Engines
Shown below are what browser engine the browsers use.

| Browser            | Engine |
| ------------------ | ------ |
| **Google Chrome**  | Blink  |
| **Microsoft Edge** | Blink  |
| **Firefox**        | Gecko  |
| **Brave**          | Blink  |
| **Opera**          | Blink  |
| **Vivaldi**        | Blink  |
| **Safari**         | WebKit |

As shown above, most browsers use the Blink engine as it is fast, compatible with most websites, and open-source as part of The Chromium Project.

## Has Sync

| Browser            | Sync |
| ------------------ | ---- |
| **Google Chrome**  | Yes  |
| **Microsoft Edge** | Yes  |
| **Firefox**        | Yes  |
| **Brave**          | Yes  |
| **Opera**          | Yes  |
| **Vivaldi**        | Yes  |
| **Safari**         | Yes  |

All of these browsers have sync, so that's not a concern!

## Browser Extension Support

| Browser            | Support   |
| ------------------ | --------- |
| **Google Chrome**  | Excellent |
| **Microsoft Edge** | Excellent |
| **Firefox**        | Good      |
| **Brave**          | Excellent |
| **Opera**          | Excellent |
| **Vivaldi**        | Excellent |
| **Safari**         | Decent    |

Most of the browsers have good extension support, but Safari's support isn't the greatest so you might not be able to find some extensions.

## Open Source

| Browser            | Open Source |
| ------------------ | ----------- |
| **Google Chrome**  | No          |
| **Microsoft Edge** | No          |
| **Firefox**        | Yes         |
| **Brave**          | No          |
| **Opera**          | No          |
| **Vivaldi**        | No          |
| **Safari**         | No          |

Firefox is the only one out of these seven browsers that is open-source, so consider going with Firefox if you care about that. 

## Browser Speed
Below are browser benchmarks[^1] for the browsers. Unfortunately, there aren't any benchmarks for Safari since it's macOS only and the results would be unfair, but it's a very fast browser if you own a Mac - just take my word for it :)

**The Tests**
- Speedometer benchmarks general web performance + JS performance and is the most important test.
- JetStream benchmarks overall browser responsiveness.
- MotionMark benchmarks overall graphics performance.

| Browser            | Speedometer 2.0 (Higher is better) | JetStream2 (Higher is better) | MotionMark (Higher is better) |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **Google Chrome**  | 144.9                              | 130.3                         | 553.4                         |
| **Microsoft Edge** | 131                                | 131.75                        | 548                           |
| **Firefox**        | 98.4                               | 82.3                          | 258                           |
| **Brave**          | 108                                | 121.5                         | 452                           |
| **Opera**          | 108.2                              | 123.3                         | 403                           |
| **Vivaldi**        | 107                                | 122.9                         | 382                           |
| **Safari**         | N/A                                | N/A                           | N/A                           |

**Overall Browser Performance**

Speedometer 2 Winners: **Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge**  
JetStream 2 Winners: **Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome**  
MotionMark Winners: **Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge**  

So as you can see from the results, Chrome and Edge are some incredibly fast and capable browsers.

# The Final Verdict
So now, the part you've been waiting for: What browser should I actually go with?

### Best Browsers for Speed
**Google Chrome** and **Microsoft Edge** are undeniably the fastest browsers. 

### My Overall Favorites
Personally, I use a combination of Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox. Firefox is great for privacy and I like that it's open-source, and Edge is very fast and has great compatibility making it a great "daily driver" browser.
